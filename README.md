# Analogue-Clock-project
Project to create an analogue clock using HTML, CSS and Javascript

I decided to attempt to create an analogue clock, rather like a widget
The project requires to animate the hour, minute and second hand to move around the clock face
which can be achieved by linking them to the get time() method in javascript.
The hands were created as div containers, then given an origin of rotation
as the exact center of the clock face.
